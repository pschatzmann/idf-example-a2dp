# a2dp-idf-example

This is just a simple demo IDF project that shows how to use the [ESP32-A2DP library](https://github.com/pschatzmann/ESP32-A2DP) together with the [arduino-audio-tools](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools) to output the audio.

These libraries need to be made available in the components directory!
